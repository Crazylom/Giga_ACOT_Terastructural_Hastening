	tech_dm_giga_ass_desc:0 "Adding £sr_dark_matter£ §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! into the process of creating supertensile materials could theoretically revolutionize the entire field with it's unique properties. No more dedicated planets for producing these valuable resources anymore."
	tech_ae_tera_hampter:0 "Dark energy terastructural assembly triumth"
	tech_ae_tera_hampter_desc:0 "Thanks to incredible endeavor of our scientists in recreating precursor technologies, we can properly add £acot_sr_dark_energy£ §Y$acot_sr_dark_energy$§! to the supertensile process, yielding even more supertensile materials for the same price. After it is done, basically no megastrucutre would take longer than a decade, at worst. \n\nOur ascension is near."
	tech_phanon_meatballs:0 "Phanon who touched my spaghett"
	tech_phanon_meatballs_desc:0 "Phanon, apparently, knew we live in a simulation. But instead of cowardly committing liven't, they harnessed inefficient code of it, and then mixed it with £aot_sr_runic_power£ §Y$aot_sr_runic_power$§! to turn into ultimate tensile material - code spaghetti! \nOn this tier of technological advancement, we can basically ask to create the megastructure we want without practical delay, and lay down every single piece at once, across entire timeline it takes. \n\nDSP time."
	tech_stellarite_big_cheez:0 "Behemoth-wide stellarite madness spreading"
	tech_stellarite_big_cheez_desc:0 "Jokes on you, Alpha tech was not the end for this field yet! With the literal power of the stars, £acot_sr_stellarite£ §Y$acot_sr_stellarite$§! can be processed by mere thoughts alone. But how would the one satisfy ever-growing demand for supertensiles without going mad? \n\nThats the trick: you must go insane first to work in that field. Considering how easily stellarite allows for casual time paradoxes and extradimensional exploitation, it will take truly insane idividuals to come up with different way of production that is not only efficient, but low-cost. \n\nYes, Sheogorath."
	#tech_runic_pokemon:0 "Runic tensile devourer summoning"
	#tech_runic_pokemon_desc:0 "Runic power is the way of the gods like us, and materials for megastructure construction are still low and slow even then. There should be, must be, is a better method. By sacrifising eons worth of our research - the amount that would ascend any onther empire - into the mirror, we could get a favor from our shroud master. With their ultimate answer, shall be ultimate way of tensile creation - Tensile Devourers! the eaters of worlds, and poopers of plank strings, that will be used for our production needs instead. \n\nHow is it better than code spaghetti? Idunno, ask Shroud master. \n\nAre they cute tho? Mayhaps."

Or maybe you are more of a warmonger and would like to fight people with your own planet-ships? Or how about simply enjoying a good meal after a long day's work serving?

Thanks to assistance of Stellarite Gourmets, the isles of this complex are composed out of dough, sauce and stellarite itself, the artists use respectfully given landscape to compose the simphony of the most delicious Dyson spheres, decompressors, and mega-shipyards. In the form of CHEESE! \n\nThe sole director of each facility is known as Sheogorath, utterly mad and dedicated worker that will silence anyone who stands in their way of delivering highest-quality cheese, for everyone's little, tiny, puny need. \n\nThey will not tolerate the ones who steal another man's cheese."

	#building_runic_champ_house_desc:0 "The trainers of runic devourerers live there. Each inside houses practically entirely new world to explore and enjoy, for runic power is that awesome. it can even have alternative universes within, so even the harshest of trainers could still find something new, and fullfill their job. Infinite combination of infinite positions in infinite timeframe across infinite universe breeds even more infinite variations of Runic Fibers(tm) from infinitely delusional trainers. \n\nDevourerers like to go into alternative universe with the sole inhabitant and pose as 'devourer of Gods', to then mess with them."
